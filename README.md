# Contaminated Model for Species Sampling
Brief explanation of the files present:
- Synthetic_Data.ipynb is the code that we use to generate synthetic dataset that we use to validate our models
- check_cont.R and frequencies_plot.R are two codes that we use to see if a dataset is contaminated or not, the first one estimating the parameters and the second one graphically
- functions.R is the file that contains all the functions that we use
- par_estimates.R is the code that we use to estimate the parameters for both type of model
- prediction.R is the code that we use to make prediction on our dataset
- plot.R ise the code that we use to generate all our plots
- All files .RData contains our results
