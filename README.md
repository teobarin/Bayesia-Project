# Contaminated Model for Species Sampling
Brief explanation of the files present:
- Synthetic_Data.ipynb is the code that we use to generate synthetic dataset that we use to validate our models
- check_cont.R and frequencies_plot.R are two codes that we use to see if a dataset is contaminated or not, the first one estimating the parameters and the second one graphically
- functions.R is the file that contains all the functions that we use
- par_estimates.R is the code that we use to estimate the parameters for both type of model
- prediction.R is the code that we use to make prediction on our dataset
- plot.R ise the code that we use to generate all our plots

Files .RData contains our results:
- freq.RData contains the frequencies of the real dataset that we use for our analysis
- functions.RData contains all our functions
- par_est.RData contains the parameters estimation values
- pred_250.RData contains the results of the prediction over 250 different shuffles of the dataset

The PDF files are the documentation that we use for the project
